# Setup Xcode Cloud
This repository is the companion repository to the article [_Getting started with Xcode Cloud_](https://paulpeelen.com/GettingStartedWithXcodeCloud).

This repository contains a SwiftUI app with a single view. The view contains a "Hello, world!" text as well as a textfield. Whatever the user types into the textfield will change the "Hello, world!" text and store in the User Defaults.
It also contains a unit test for the NameManager, which stores the entered text.

The purpose of this repository is to show how to setup Xcode Cloud for a project and how to get it to run tests and archive an app.
